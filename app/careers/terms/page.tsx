                        <h2>SECTION I: INTERPRETATION, LEXICAL DEFINITIONS, AND PREAMBLE OF NON-EXISTENCE</h2>
                    </header>

                    <h3>PART A: DEFINITIONAL FRAMEWORK AND RULES OF CONSTRUCTION</h3>
                    <p>
                        BEFORE any mutual understanding regarding the nature of tasks, code, or "internship" can be established, the following lexical definitions must be accepted as absolute, immutable, and non-negotiable truths governing this text. The vocabulary used herein is specific to this "Project" and supersedes any standard dictionary definitions or definitions found in the General Clauses Act, 1897.
                    </p>

                    <h4>1.1 THE "ENTITY" (COERROR)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The term "Coerror," "The Construct," "The Project," "Us," "We," or "The Originators," whenever appearing in this text, shall be interpreted NOT as a reference to a registered Body Corporate, Private Limited Company, or Limited Liability Partnership.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> It refers solely to the "Abstract Unincorporated Collective of Voluntary Researchers."</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Legal Scope:</strong> The "Entity" exists only as a shared mental concept and a GitHub repository. It possesses no physical body, no tax identification, and no distinct legal personality capable of being sued. Any reference to "The Company" in verbal communication is a colloquial error and shall be legally read as "The Project."
                    </p>

                    <h4>1.2 THE "PARTICIPANT" (HE / SHE / THE INTERN)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The terms "Intern," "Applicant," "Developer," "You," "User," or "Contributor" shall refer to the individual accepting these terms.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Gender Neutrality & Pronoun Expansion:</strong> For the sake of syntactic brevity and without prejudice to gender identity, any use of the masculine pronoun "HE" or "HIM" or the feminine pronoun "SHE" or "HER" within this document shall be immediately and automatically interpreted to include all genders, non-binary identities, and plural entities.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"He" does not imply a male; it implies "The Liability Bearer."</li>
                        <li>"She" does not imply a female; it implies "The Voluntary Code Contributor."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Status of the Participant:</strong> The Participant is defined strictly as a "Volunteer Hobbyist." Under no circumstances shall the Participant be defined as an "Employee," "Workman," "Agent," or "Servant" of the Entity.</p>

                    <h4>1.3 "THE INTERNSHIP" (THE NON-JOB)</h4>
                    <p>The term "Internship" is used herein purely for social convenience and academic nomenclature.</p>
                    <p><strong>Legal Redefinition:</strong> In this document, "Internship" is legally defined as "A Non-Compensated, Voluntary Period of Self-Learning using the Originators' Proprietary Codebase."</p>
                    <p><strong>Exclusion:</strong> It explicitly excludes any relationship defined under the Apprentices Act, 1961.</p>

                    <h4>1.4 "THE OL" (OFFER LETTER)</h4>
                    <p>The term "Offer Letter," "OL," "Appointment Letter," or "Joining Letter" refers to the PDF or email communication sent to the Participant.</p>
                    <p><strong>Legal Status:</strong> This document is defined as a "Ceremonial Artifact." It is a non-binding memorandum of intent. It is NOT an employment contract.</p>

                    <h3>PART B: TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT AND VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATION</h3>
                    <p><em>REFERENCE: SECTION I (CONTINUED) – JURIDICAL ABSENCE AND NULLITY</em></p>

                    <h4>1.5 PREAMBLE OF NON-INCORPORATION</h4>
                    <p>
                        BE IT KNOWN to all parties, assignees, heirs, executors, and purported applicants, that the Entity "COERROR" operates strictly, exclusively, and fundamentally as a pre-incorporation, non-juridical, unincorporated association. The Entity explicitly denies, refutes, and abjures the status of a "Company" under the Companies Act, 2013, or any analogous statute within the territorial sovereignty of India.
                    </p>

                    <h4>1.6 THE DOCTRINE OF NULLITY (AB INITIO)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Participant hereby acknowledges, with full cognitive agency and sans coercion (without force), that the Entity possesses no legal personality separate from its individual founders.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Consequence:</strong> The Entity is legally incapable of entering into binding employment contracts. Any signature on an "Offer Letter" is a signature on a personal agreement between two individuals, not a corporate bond.</p>
                    <p><strong>Waiver:</strong> The Participant agrees that they cannot sue "Coerror" because "Coerror" does not legally exist. You cannot sue a ghost.</p>

                    <h4>1.7 REPRESENTATIONAL ARTIFACTS AND STAMPS</h4>
                    <p>
                        WHEREAS, the Entity may issue documents bearing graphical imprints resembling "Official Stamps," "Seals," "QR Codes," or "Corporate Insignia" (hereinafter "The Decor").
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Agreement:</strong> The Participant expressly agrees that these Stamps are for aesthetic and morale-boosting purposes only.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prohibition on Reliance:</strong> The Participant is strictly prohibited from presenting these documents to Banks for Loans, Embassies for Visas, or Courts for Claims as proof of "Stable Employment." If the Participant does so, they commit fraud upon that third party at their own risk. The Entity assumes no liability for the rejection or invalidation of these documents by any government authority.</p>

                    <h4>1.8 DECLARATION OF SOUND MIND AND VOLUNTARY CONSENT</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Participant, being of sound mind (Compos Mentis) and having attained the age of majority, hereby waives any claim of "Misrepresentation."
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Declaration:</strong> "I, the Participant (He/She), understand that I am joining a garage-phase experiment. I understand that the 'Offer Letter' is a formalized handshake. I understand that if the project dissolves tomorrow, I have no legal standing to claim damages, unpaid wages, or emotional distress."</p>

                    <h4>1.9 EXCLUSION OF STATUTORY RECOURSE</h4>
                    <p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN, IT IS MUTUALLY AGREED THAT THE PARTICIPANT WAIVES ALL RIGHTS UNDER:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.</li>
                        <li>The Payment of Wages Act, 1936.</li>
                        <li>The Minimum Wages Act, 1948.</li>
                        <li>The Shops and Establishments Act (State Specific).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Participant acknowledges that since the Entity is not a "Shop" or "Commercial Establishment" or "Industry" but a "Private Hobby Group," these laws have zero jurisdiction over this engagement.</p>

                        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
                            EFFECTIVE DATE: 09/12/2025 | REFERENCE: CE-LEGAL-002-FIN-V1 | APPLICABILITY: GLOBAL / EXTRATERRITORIAL
                        </p>
                    </header>

                    <h3>2.0 PREAMBLE OF FINANCIAL NON-OBLIGATION</h3>
                    <p>
                        WHEREAS, the Participant (hereinafter referred to as the "Adherent," "Volunteer," or "Recipient") has voluntarily approached the Entity (Coerror) for the express purpose of self-education, skill acquisition, and exposure to the codebase; AND WHEREAS, the Entity operates as a non-revenue-generating, pre-incorporation research collective with no formal capitalization or banking treasury;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED that the engagement is FUNDAMENTALLY NON-COMMERCIAL. The Participant explicitly acknowledges that they are NOT trading their labor for wages. They are trading their time for knowledge. As such, the concept of "Remuneration" is legally null and void within this specific engagement.
                    </p>

                    <h4>2.1 THE DEFINITION OF "STIPEND" AS "EX GRATIA" (GIFT)</h4>
                    <p><strong>2.1.1 Semantic Redefinition:</strong> Any mention of the terms "Stipend," "Salary," "Pay," "Compensation," "CTC," or "Fees" in any verbal conversation, WhatsApp chat, email, or the ceremonial "Offer Letter" shall be legally interpreted strictly as "Honorarium" or "Ex Gratia Payment."</p>

                    <p><strong>2.1.2 The "Gift" Logic:</strong> The Participant understands that any money transferred to their bank account by the Originators is NOT a payment for services rendered. It is a voluntary, personal gift from one individual (the Founder) to another individual (the Participant) to support their learning journey.</p>

                    <p><strong>No "Quid Pro Quo":</strong> The payment is not legally tied to the hours worked.</p>
                    <p><strong>No Entitlement:</strong> The Participant has NO LEGAL RIGHT to demand this money. If the Originator decides not to send the gift in a particular month due to lack of funds or personal whim, the Participant has no legal ground to sue for "Unpaid Wages."</p>

                    <p><strong>2.1.3 Waiver of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936:</strong> The Participant explicitly waives protection under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. The Participant admits that they are not an "Employed Person" under Section 1(4) of the Act, and Coerror is not an "Industrial or Other Establishment" under Section 2(ii) of the Act. Therefore, no claim for delayed payments or deductions can be filed before any Labor Commissioner.</p>

                    <h4>2.2 TOTAL EXCLUSION OF STATUTORY BENEFITS (THE "NO PERKS" CLAUSE)</h4>
                    <p>The Participant acknowledges that since Coerror is not a registered company, it is legally incapable of providing statutory benefits. The Participant explicitly waives, releases, and forever discharges the Entity from any obligation to provide the following:</p>

                    <p><strong>2.2.1 Provident Fund (PF):</strong> The Participant acknowledges that the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 does not apply. No percentage of the "Gift" will be deducted for PF, and the Entity will make no matching contribution. The Participant is solely responsible for their own retirement planning.</p>

                    <p><strong>2.2.2 Employee State Insurance (ESI):</strong> The Participant acknowledges that they are NOT insured by the Entity for any medical contingencies. The Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 is inapplicable. If the Participant falls ill, requires hospitalization, or suffers a medical emergency (whether work-related or not), the Entity bears ZERO LIABILITY for medical bills.</p>

                    <p><strong>2.2.3 Gratuity and Bonuses:</strong> The Participant waives all rights under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 and the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965. Regardless of how long the Participant contributes code (even if exceeding 5 years), no Gratuity is payable. No Diwali Bonus, Performance Bonus, or Joining Bonus is legally owed, even if promised verbally.</p>

                    <p><strong>2.2.4 Paid Leaves and Holidays:</strong> The Participant acknowledges that there is no concept of "Paid Leave," "Casual Leave (CL)," "Sick Leave (SL)," or "Privilege Leave (PL)." Since there is no employment, there is no leave policy. If the Participant does not contribute code, the "Gift" (Stipend) may be withheld entirely at the Originator's discretion.</p>

                    <h4>2.3 TAXATION AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY (THE "YOU PAY YOUR OWN TAX" CLAUSE)</h4>
                    <p><strong>2.3.1 Non-Deduction of TDS:</strong> Since the Entity is unregistered and does not possess a TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number), we will NOT deduct TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) under Section 192 or 194J of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</p>

                    <p><strong>2.3.2 Sole Liability of the Participant:</strong> The Participant accepts full responsibility for declaring any funds received from the Originators to the Income Tax Department.</p>

                    <p><strong>Classification of Income:</strong> The Participant agrees to classify these receipts as "Income from Other Sources" or "Gifts" in their ITR (Income Tax Return).</p>

                    <p><strong>Indemnification:</strong> If the Income Tax Department issues a notice to the Participant regarding undeclared income, the Participant agrees NOT to implicate Coerror or its founders. The Participant shall pay all taxes, cesses, surcharges, and penalties personally. The Entity assumes no liability for the Participant’s tax evasion or misreporting.</p>

                    <h4>2.4 OPERATIONAL EXPENSES AND THE "BRING YOUR OWN DEVICE" (BYOD) MANDATE</h4>
                    <p><strong>2.4.1 Hardware and Infrastructure:</strong> The Participant acknowledges that Coerror is a "Garage Phase" project. The Entity provides NOTHING.</p>

                    <p><strong>Laptops/Computers:</strong> The Participant must utilize their own personal computing device. The Entity is NOT LIABLE for any wear and tear, motherboard failure, battery degradation, screen damage, or obsolescence of the Participant's personal laptop caused by running heavy code, Docker containers, or Rust compilations.</p>

                    <p><strong>Electricity:</strong> The Entity will not reimburse electricity bills.</p>

                    <p><strong>Internet/Data:</strong> The Participant bears the full cost of their high-speed internet connection. No "Wi-Fi Allowance" or "Data Reimbursement" shall be provided.</p>

                    <p><strong>2.4.2 Software Licenses:</strong> The Participant agrees to use only free, open-source, or personally licensed software. If the Participant installs pirated software (e.g., cracked IDEs, Windows keys) to work on the Project, the Participant assumes SOLE CRIMINAL LIABILITY under the Copyright Act, 1957. The Entity explicitly forbids piracy but assumes no liability for policing the Participant’s personal machine.</p>

                    <h4>2.5 TRANSACTIONAL MECHANICS AND BANKING DISCLAIMER</h4>
                    <p><strong>2.5.1 Mode of Transfer:</strong> Any financial transfer from the Entity to the Participant will likely be via UPI (Unified Payments Interface), IMPS, or NEFT from a Personal Savings Account of one of the Originators.</p>

                    <p><strong>No Corporate Account:</strong> The Participant acknowledges they will see a personal name (e.g., "Sumit Soni") in their bank statement, not "Coerror Pvt Ltd."</p>

                    <p><strong>Acceptance of Facts:</strong> The Participant agrees that accepting these personal transfers constitutes definitive proof that they understand the nature of this engagement is a private, peer-to-peer collaboration, not a corporate employment.</p>

                    <p><strong>2.5.2 Irregularity of Payments:</strong> The Participant acknowledges that as this is a boot-strapped, unfunded project, "Stipend" dates are NOT FIXED. Payments may be delayed by days, weeks, or months.</p>

                    <p><strong>Waiver of Interest:</strong> The Participant agrees NOT to claim interest on delayed payments.</p>

                    <p><strong>No "Payday":</strong> There is no "1st of the month" guarantee. Funds are released solely based on the Originator's liquidity.</p>

                    <h4>2.6 CLAWBACK AND FORFEITURE CLAUSE (AGGRESSIVE)</h4>
                    <p><strong>2.6.1 Right to Withhold:</strong> The Entity reserves the absolute, dictatorial right to withhold, forfeit, or cancel any pending "Stipend" or "Gift" if:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>(a) The Participant leaves without a formal handover.</li>
                        <li>(b) The Participant writes "Bad Code" that causes the server to crash.</li>
                        <li>(c) The Participant is rude, unresponsive, or "Ghosts" the team on Slack/Discord.</li>
                        <li>(d) The Participant disparages the Project on social media.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>2.6.2 The Clawback (Return of Funds):</strong> In the event that the Participant is found to have stolen data, leaked API keys, or committed intellectual property theft, the Participant agrees to REFUND all stipends received from the beginning of their association within 7 (seven) days of a demand notice. This is agreed upon as a "Pre-estimated Liquidated Damage" for the breach of trust.</p>

                    <h4>2.7 WAIVER OF "OPPORTUNITY COST" AND DAMAGES</h4>
                    <p><strong>2.7.1 No Claim for "Wasted Time":</strong> The Participant agrees that if, after 6 months of working with Coerror, they do not receive a permanent job offer, stock options, or a certificate, they cannot sue the Entity for "Loss of Career Opportunity" or "Wasted Time." The value of the engagement is defined strictly as the "Learning Experience," which has already been consumed by the Participant instantly upon writing code.</p>

                    <p><strong>2.7.2 Survival of Financial Indemnity:</strong> This Section II (Financial Covenants) shall survive the termination of the Participant’s association. Even after leaving the Project, the Participant cannot file a retroactive claim for "Unpaid Wages" for the period they were associated.</p>

                    <h4>2.8 DECLARATION OF SOUND MIND AND VOLUNTARY CONSENT REGARDING MONEY</h4>
                    <p>I, THE UNDERSIGNED, HEREBY DECLARE:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I know I am not getting a salary; I am getting a gift.</li>
                        <li>I know Coerror has no money and no legal obligation to pay me.</li>
                        <li>I know I have to pay my own taxes.</li>
                        <li>I know if my laptop breaks, Coerror won't buy me a new one.</li>
                        <li>I am agreeing to this FINANCIAL SUICIDE of my rights because I value the learning opportunity more than the legal protection.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3.0 PREAMBLE OF TOTALITY OF OWNERSHIP</h3>
                    <p>
                        WHEREAS, the Participant (hereinafter "The Assignor") will be granted access to the proprietary repositories, trade secrets, architectural diagrams, and algorithmic logic (hereinafter "The Assets") of the Entity (Coerror); AND WHEREAS, the Assignor will be creating, modifying, debugging, and compiling source code during their voluntary association;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED that the ownership of ANY AND ALL work product generated by the Assignor shall vest exclusively, immediately, and perpetually with the Originators (The Founders) of Coerror. The Assignor retains ZERO rights to the code they write.
                    </p>

                    <h4>3.1 THE "WORK MADE FOR HIRE" FICTION AND ASSIGNMENT</h4>
                    <p><strong>3.1.1 Irrevocable Assignment of Rights:</strong> The Assignor hereby irrevocably, unconditionally, and perpetually assigns, transfers, and conveys to the Originators of Coerror all worldwide right, title, and interest in and to any "Inventions" created during the Term of Association.</p>

                    <p><strong>Definition of "Inventions":</strong> This includes, but is not limited to: Source Code (Rust, Python, Java, etc.), Object Code, Scripts, UI/UX Designs, Documentation, API Specifications, Algorithms, Database Schemas (ClickHouse/SQL), Logos, Marketing Copy, Blog Posts, and even "casual ideas" discussed on Slack/Discord.</p>

                    <p><strong>Automatic Transfer:</strong> The transfer of ownership occurs instantaneously upon the creation of the work. The moment the Assignor types a line of code and hits "Save" (or commits to Git), that line of code ceases to belong to them and belongs to the Originators.</p>

                    <p><strong>3.1.2 Waiver of Moral Rights:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (including Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957), the Assignor expressly waives any and all "Moral Rights."</p>

                    <p><strong>No Attribution:</strong> The Originators are under NO OBLIGATION to credit the Assignor as the author of the code. We can remove your name from the Author tag in Git commits. We can publish the code under our own names.</p>

                    <p><strong>Right to Modify:</strong> The Originators have the absolute right to butcher, modify, distort, or delete the Assignor's code without seeking permission.</p>

                    <p><strong>3.1.3 The "No Backup" Rule:</strong> The Assignor agrees that they are PROHIBITED from keeping a personal copy of the source code. Cloning the repository to a personal GitHub account (forking) without explicit written permission is legally defined herein as "Theft of Trade Secrets" and will be prosecuted.</p>

                    <h4>3.2 PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIALITY</h4>
                    <p><strong>3.2.1 Definition of Confidential Information:</strong> "Confidential Information" shall be interpreted broadly to include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Source code, API keys, AWS/GCP credentials, database passwords, architecture diagrams.</li>
                        <li><strong>Business Data:</strong> Launch dates, marketing strategies, user lists (even if empty), financial status (or lack thereof).</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Discourse:</strong> Screenshots of Slack chats, Discord voice logs, or private emails.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>3.2.2 The "Infinite Silence" Clause:</strong> The duty of confidentiality is PERPETUAL. It does not end when the internship ends. Even 10 years from now, the Assignor cannot reveal how Coerror’s backend works.</p>

                    <p><strong>Strict Liability for Leaks:</strong> If the Assignor accidentally commits an API Key (e.g., OpenAI Key, AWS Secret Key) to a public GitHub repository, the Assignor shall be PERSONALLY LIABLE for any financial loss incurred (e.g., if a bot steals the key and mines crypto, landing Coerror with a $10,000 bill, the Assignor must pay it).</p>

                    <p><strong>3.2.3 Social Media Blackout:</strong> The Assignor is prohibited from posting "Screenshots of Code" or "Internal Dashboards" on LinkedIn, Twitter (X), or Instagram to "show off" their work, unless explicitly approved in writing. Sharing internal bugs or "rants" about the codebase on social media is a material breach of this agreement.</p>

                    <h4>3.3 THIRD-PARTY IP AND OPEN SOURCE CONTAMINATION</h4>
                    <p><strong>3.3.1 The "Clean Room" Mandate:</strong> The Assignor warrants that all code contributed is original.</p>

                    <p><strong>No Plagiarism:</strong> The Assignor shall not copy-paste code from proprietary sources (e.g., StackOverflow answers with restrictive licenses, or code from their previous employer).</p>

                    <p><strong>No GPL Contamination:</strong> The Assignor is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from using libraries licensed under GPL, AGPL, or MPL (Copyleft licenses) that would legally force Coerror to open-source its entire proprietary codebase. If the Assignor introduces a GPL library that "infects" the codebase, the Assignor is liable for the destruction of the Entity's proprietary value.</p>

                    <p><strong>3.3.2 Indemnification for IP Infringement:</strong> If a third party (e.g., Oracle, Google, or another startup) sues Coerror claiming that the code written by the Assignor infringes their patent or copyright, the Assignor agrees to INDEMNIFY (pay for) Coerror’s legal defense. The Entity takes no responsibility for the Assignor’s intellectual theft.</p>

                    <h4>3.4 DATA SECURITY AND DEVICE HYGIENE</h4>
                    <p><strong>3.4.1 BYOD Security Protocol:</strong> Since the Assignor uses a personal device (Laptop), the Assignor agrees to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintain an active, updated Antivirus/Firewall.</li>
                        <li>Encrypt the hard drive where Coerror code is stored.</li>
                        <li>NEVER access the codebase from a public cyber-cafe or unsecured public Wi-Fi without a VPN.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>3.4.2 The "Remote Wipe" Authorization:</strong> In the event of a security breach or termination, the Assignor grants the Entity the ethical authorization (even if technical capability is absent) to demand the immediate formatting or deletion of specific partitions on the Assignor’s device containing Coerror data. Refusal to comply is an admission of data theft.</p>

                    <h4>3.5 RETURN OF PROPERTY AND SURVIVAL OF TERMS</h4>
                    <p><strong>3.5.1 The Exit Protocol:</strong> Upon termination of the association (whether voluntary or forced), the Assignor must:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Delete all local copies of the repository.</li>
                        <li>Delete all AWS/Cloud credentials saved in their terminal/browser.</li>
                        <li>Return (or destroy) any physical notes or diagrams related to the logic.</li>
                        <li>Sign a fresh "Termination Certificate" reaffirming that they hold no data (if requested).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>3.5.2 Survival:</strong> The provisions of this Section III (IP and Confidentiality) shall survive the termination of this Agreement forever. The Assignor can be sued for IP theft 20 years from now if they use Coerror’s core algorithm to start a rival company.</p>

                    <h4>3.6 DECLARATION OF SOUND MIND AND VOLUNTARY CONSENT REGARDING IP</h4>
                    <p>I, THE UNDERSIGNED, HEREBY CONFIRM:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I own nothing I create here. Every line of code belongs to Coerror.</li>
                        <li>I will not put this code on my personal GitHub as a "Portfolio Project" without permission.</li>
                        <li>I will not leak API keys. If I do, I will pay the bill.</li>
                        <li>I am giving away my intellectual labor for free, and I waive my moral rights to be recognized for it.</li>
                        <li>I understand this is necessary for the Entity to remain "safe" and proprietary.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
                            EFFECTIVE DATE: 09/12/2025 | REFERENCE: CE-LEGAL-004-LIABILITY-X | RISK LEVEL: MAXIMUM / AT YOUR OWN PERIL

                    </header>

                    <h3>4.0 PREAMBLE OF TOTAL IMMUNITY</h3>
                    <p>
                        NOTWITHSTANDING anything to the contrary contained in any verbal agreement, "Offer Letter," WhatsApp chat, or hallucinated expectation of the Participant, the Entity (Coerror) and its Originators hereby disclaim ANY AND ALL liability for any damages, losses, injuries, or fatalities arising out of the Participant’s association with the Project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Participant acknowledges that they are entering this association at their SOLE AND ABSOLUTE RISK. The Entity provides the platform "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," with all faults, bugs, viruses, and imperfections, and without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
                    </p>

                    <h4>4.1 THE "MELTING LAPTOP" AND HARDWARE DAMAGE CLAUSE</h4>
                    <p><strong>4.1.1 Assumption of Technological Risk:</strong> The Participant acknowledges that the codebase of Coerror (built on Rust, Kafka, ClickHouse, and Docker) is computationally intensive ("Heavy").</p>

                    <p><strong>Thermal Throttling & Damage:</strong> The Participant agrees that running infinite loops, heavy compilations, or memory-leaking scripts may cause their personal device (Laptop/PC) to overheat, degrade, thermal-throttle, or suffer permanent silicon damage.</p>

                    <p><strong>Waiver:</strong> In the event that the Participant’s CPU melts, the motherboard shorts, the battery explodes, or the SSD corrupts due to the workload, the Entity is NOT LIABLE for the cost of repair or replacement. The Entity will not buy you a new MacBook.</p>

                    <p><strong>4.1.2 Data Corruption and Loss:</strong> The Entity assumes no responsibility for the integrity of the data on the Participant’s personal machine.</p>

                    <p><strong>The "rm -rf" Risk:</strong> If a script provided by the Entity accidentally wipes the Participant’s hard drive (e.g., a poorly written Bash script), the Entity is immune from prosecution. The Participant is expected to run all code in a sandbox/virtual machine. Failure to do so is the Participant’s negligence.</p>

                    <h4>4.2 MEDICAL, ERGONOMIC, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISCLAIMER</h4>
                    <p><strong>4.2.1 The "Remote Work" Health Waiver:</strong> Since the Entity does not provide an office, ergonomic chairs, or regulated lighting, the Entity disclaims all liability for "Occupational Hazards" associated with coding from home. The Participant waives the right to sue for:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Musculoskeletal Disorders:</strong> Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI), Spondylitis, or chronic back pain caused by sitting on a bed/sofa while coding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ocular Damage:</strong> Myopia, eye strain, "Computer Vision Syndrome," or headaches caused by staring at a screen for 12 hours debugging Rust code.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sedentary Lifestyle Risks:</strong> Obesity, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or cardiovascular issues arising from a lack of physical movement during "Crunch Time."</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>4.2.2 Psychological Distress and "Burnout":</strong> The Participant acknowledges that the startup environment is high-pressure, chaotic, and often toxic.</p>

                    <p><strong>No Claim for Stress:</strong> The Entity is not liable for the Participant’s anxiety, depression, sleep deprivation, "Imposter Syndrome," or "Burnout" resulting from aggressive deadlines, harsh code reviews, or the failure of the project. The Participant agrees that emotional distress is a natural byproduct of ambition.</p>

                    <h4>4.3 FORCE MAJEURE (THE "ACT OF GOD" EXPANSION)</h4>
                    <p><strong>4.3.1 Absolute Suspension of Obligations:</strong> The Entity shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations (e.g., providing mentorship, reviewing code, keeping servers online) where such failure results from any cause beyond the Entity’s reasonable control, including but not limited to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Acts of Nature:</strong> Earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, solar flares, geomagnetic storms, or meteor strikes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Civil Unrest:</strong> War, terrorism, riots, coup d'état, martial law, or national emergency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technological Collapse:</strong> Failure of the Internet backbone (Undersea cables), total outage of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) failure, GitHub downtime, or a global "Y2K-style" bug.</li>
                        <li><strong>Biological Threats:</strong> Pandemics, epidemics, plagues, or zombie apocalypses (included herein to cover all biological eventualities).</li>
                        <li><strong>AI Singularity:</strong> In the event that Artificial Intelligence becomes sentient and takes over the infrastructure, rendering human inputs irrelevant, the Entity is absolved of all management duties.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>4.3.2 Government Action:</strong> If the Government of India or any other jurisdiction bans the technology used by Coerror (e.g., a ban on Encryption or Crypto-adjacent tech), or shuts down the Internet, the Project will cease immediately without compensation to the Participant.</p>

                    <h4>4.4 THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM LIABILITY</h4>
                    <p><strong>4.4.1 No Endorsement of Tools:</strong> The Project relies on third-party tools like Slack, Discord, Notion, Linear, and GitHub.</p>

                    <p><strong>Data Leaks by Third Parties:</strong> If Discord gets hacked and the Participant’s private chats are leaked, or if Notion loses the Participant’s documentation, Coerror is NOT LIABLE. The Participant has a direct relationship with those service providers via their own Terms of Service.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ban/Suspension:</strong> If the Participant’s GitHub account is "Flagged" or "Banned" because of association with Coerror’s repositories (e.g., for spamming API requests), the Entity is not responsible for restoring the account.</p>

                    <h4>4.5 INDEMNIFICATION (THE "YOU PAY FOR US" CLAUSE)</h4>
                    <p><strong>4.5.1 The Shield:</strong> The Participant agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Entity, its Originators, and their families from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Your Violation:</strong> The Participant’s violation of any term of this Agreement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your Negligence:</strong> The Participant’s negligent coding (e.g., introducing a vulnerability that gets the Entity hacked).</li>
                        <li><strong>Your Misconduct:</strong> The Participant harassing other interns, posting offensive content on Slack, or committing crimes using the Entity’s infrastructure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your Taxes:</strong> The Participant’s failure to pay Income Tax.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>4.5.2 Meaning of Indemnification:</strong> This means if someone sues Coerror because of something you did, YOU have to pay for Coerror’s lawyers and YOU have to pay the fine.</p>

                    <h4>4.6 LIMITATION OF DAMAGES (THE "ZERO RUPEE" CAP)</h4>
                    <p><strong>4.6.1 The Cap:</strong> IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ENTITY’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO THE PARTICIPANT FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY THE ENTITY TO THE PARTICIPANT IN THE PRECEDING ONE (1) MONTH.</p>

                    <p><strong>4.6.2 The Reality:</strong> Since the Participant is often unpaid or receives only irregular "Gifts," the liability cap is effectively ZERO RUPEES (₹0).</p>

                    <p><strong>Consequential Damages:</strong> Under no circumstances will the Entity be liable for "Lost Profits," "Lost Data," "Loss of Reputation," or "Punitive Damages."</p>

                    <h4>4.7 SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST (AND THIS CLAUSE)</h4>
                    <p><strong>4.7.1 Perpetuity:</strong> The waivers contained in this Section IV are perpetual. The Participant cannot sue the Entity for back pain 5 years from now, claiming it originated during the internship.</p>

                    <h4>4.8 DECLARATION OF SOUND MIND AND VOLUNTARY CONSENT REGARDING RISKS</h4>
                    <p>I, THE UNDERSIGNED, HEREBY CONFIRM:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I realize coding is sedentary and dangerous to my health.</li>
                        <li>I realize my laptop might break, and Coerror owes me nothing.</li>
                        <li>I realize that if the internet shuts down or the government bans the app, the internship is over.</li>
                        <li>I agree that Coerror’s liability to me is capped at Zero Rupees.</li>
                        <li>I am assuming all risks—physical, financial, and digital—voluntarily.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>5.0 PREAMBLE OF TERMINATION AT WILL</h3>
                    <p>
                        WHEREAS, the association between the Entity (Coerror) and the Participant (The Intern/Volunteer) is founded upon the principles of "At-Will" collaboration and voluntary contribution; NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY AGREED that the engagement possesses no fixed tenure, no guaranteed duration, and no security of tenure. The association exists only as long as the Originators (Founders) desire it to exist.
                    </p>

                    <h4>5.1 THE DOCTRINE OF "INSTANT SEVERANCE" (TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE)</h4>
                    <p><strong>5.1.1 Unilateral Right to Terminate:</strong> The Entity reserves the absolute, unchallengeable, and dictatorial right to terminate the Participant’s association INSTANTLY, at any time, for any reason, or for NO REASON AT ALL ("Termination for Convenience").</p>

                    <p><strong>No Notice Period:</strong> The Entity is under NO OBLIGATION to provide a "Two Weeks Notice," "One Month Notice," or even a "One Hour Notice." The termination is effective the moment the Participant’s access to Slack/GitHub is revoked.</p>

                    <p><strong>No Explanation Required:</strong> The Originators are not required to explain why the Participant is being removed. Whether it is due to "Budget Cuts," "Project Pivot," "Vibe Mismatch," or simply because the Founder is in a bad mood, the decision is final and non-negotiable.</p>

                    <p><strong>5.1.2 Automatic Termination (Ipso Facto):</strong> The engagement shall automatically terminate without any written notice upon the occurrence of any of the following events:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The "Ghosting" Event:</strong> If the Participant fails to push code to GitHub for a period of 3 (three) consecutive days without prior intimation.</li>
                        <li><strong>The "Incompetence" Event:</strong> If the Participant breaks the production build more than twice.</li>
                        <li><strong>The "Dissolution" Event:</strong> If the Coerror project is abandoned, paused, or shut down by the Originators.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>5.2 TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (THE "BLACKLIST" CLAUSE)</h4>
                    <p><strong>5.2.1 Grounds for Immediate Expulsion:</strong> The Entity may terminate the Participant with "Cause" and label them as "Blacklisted" in the internal database for strictly prohibited behaviors, including but not limited to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Insubordination:</strong> Refusing to follow the architectural guidelines set by the Lead Engineer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Toxic Behavior:</strong> Engaging in political arguments, "woke" activism, or harassment on the internal Discord server.</li>
                        <li><strong>Moonlighting:</strong> Working for a direct competitor or leaking ideas to another hackathon team.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Exfiltration:</strong> Attempting to download the entire user database (CSV/SQL dump).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>5.2.2 Consequences of "Termination for Cause":</strong> If terminated for cause:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Participant forfeits all pending "Gifts" or "Stipends."</li>
                        <li>The Participant is permanently banned from future re-hiring.</li>
                        <li>The Entity reserves the right to publish a "Hall of Shame" (internally) detailing the breach.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>5.3 POST-TERMINATION OBLIGATIONS (THE "DIGITAL WALK OF SHAME")</h4>
                    <p><strong>5.3.1 Immediate Cessation of Representation:</strong> Upon termination, the Participant must IMMEDIATELY (within 1 hour):</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Remove "Intern at Coerror" from their LinkedIn Headline.</li>
                        <li>Remove "Coerror" from their Twitter/Instagram bio.</li>
                        <li>Delete any "Welcome Kits" or "Swag" photos that imply an active relationship.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cease and Desist:</strong> Stop representing themselves as an agent of the Entity. Failure to do so constitutes "Impersonation" and may lead to legal action under the Indian Penal Code.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>5.3.2 Revocation of Access:</strong> The Participant acknowledges that their corporate email (if any), Slack account, Notion access, and GitHub permissions will be "Nuked" (deleted/revoked) instantly. The Entity is not responsible for any personal data (e.g., personal notes, saved links) the Participant may have left in the company workspace. It will be deleted permanently.</p>

                    <p><strong>5.3.3 The "No Certificate" Policy:</strong> CRITICAL: The Participant acknowledges that upon termination (especially if before the completion of a specific milestone), the Entity is UNDER NO OBLIGATION to issue:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>An Internship Completion Certificate.</li>
                        <li>A Letter of Recommendation (LOR).</li>
                        <li>A "Relieving Letter."</li>
                        <li>An Experience Letter.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>The "Ghost" Reality:</strong> The Participant agrees that they may leave this engagement with absolutely nothing to show for it on paper. The "Experience" gained is the only reward.</p>

                    <h4>5.4 DISPUTE RESOLUTION (THE "ANTI-COURT" MECHANISM)</h4>
                    <p><strong>5.4.1 Waiver of Civil Courts and Labor Tribunals:</strong> The Participant expressly waives their right to file a lawsuit in any Civil Court, Labor Court, Industrial Tribunal, or Consumer Forum against the Entity or its Originators. The Participant acknowledges that the "Unregistered" nature of the Entity makes standard litigation procedurally void.</p>

                    <p><strong>5.4.2 Mandatory Private Mediation:</strong> In the unlikely event of a dispute (e.g., regarding IP ownership or harassment), the Participant agrees to the following strict hierarchy of resolution:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Level 1 (Internal Review):</strong> The Participant must send a detailed email to the Originators. The Originators have 30 days to reply (or ignore it).</li>
                        <li><strong>Level 2 (Private Mediation):</strong> If unresolved, the dispute shall be referred to a Sole Mediator appointed exclusively by the Originators. The mediation shall take place virtually or at a coffee shop designated by the Originators. The Participant agrees to accept the Mediator’s "Gentleman’s Guidance" as final.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>5.4.3 The "Arbitration Trap":</strong> If Mediation fails, the dispute shall be referred to Sole Arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Seat of Arbitration:</strong> The seat and venue shall be strictly [Insert Your Home City, e.g., Gurgaon], India.</li>
                        <li><strong>Language:</strong> English.</li>
                        <li><strong>Arbitrator Selection:</strong> The Sole Arbitrator shall be appointed by the Originators (Coerror).</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost Bearing:</strong> The Participant agrees to bear 100% of the Arbitration Costs (including the Arbitrator’s fees and Coerror’s legal fees) if the Participant loses the case. This clause acts as a financial deterrent against frivolous lawsuits.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>5.5 CLASS ACTION WAIVER (THE "DIVIDE AND CONQUER" CLAUSE)</h4>
                    <p><strong>5.5.1 Individual Capacity Only:</strong> The Participant agrees that any claim against Coerror must be brought in the Participant’s individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, or representative proceeding.</p>

                    <p><strong>No Unionization:</strong> The Participant agrees not to form a "WhatsApp Group" with other aggrieved interns to collectively sue the Entity. Each dispute must be fought alone.</p>

                    <h4>5.6 GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION (THE "HOME TURF" ADVANTAGE)</h4>
                    <p><strong>5.6.1 Governing Law:</strong> This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of India, specifically excluding:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Labor Laws (as defined in Section I).</li>
                        <li>The Conflict of Laws principles.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>5.6.2 Exclusive Jurisdiction:</strong> Subject to the Arbitration clause, the Courts at [Insert Your City, e.g., Bangalore/Gurgaon] shall have EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION over any matter arising out of this Agreement. The Participant explicitly waives the jurisdiction of courts in their own city/state of residence.</p>

                    <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> If the Intern lives in Mumbai and you are in Bangalore, they have to travel to Bangalore to sue you. They cannot sue you in Mumbai.</p>

                    <h4>5.7 LIMITATION PERIOD (THE "TIME BAR")</h4>
                    <p><strong>5.7.1 The 30-Day Statute of Limitations:</strong> NOTWITHSTANDING any statute to the contrary (e.g., the Limitation Act, 1963), the Participant agrees that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to this Agreement or the use of the Coerror platform must be filed within THIRTY (30) DAYS after such claim or cause of action arose.</p>

                    <p><strong>Forever Barred:</strong> If the claim is not filed within 30 days, it shall be forever barred. This means if the Participant realizes 6 months later that they want to sue, it is legally too late.</p>

                    <h4>5.8 DECLARATION OF SOUND MIND AND VOLUNTARY CONSENT REGARDING TERMINATION</h4>
                    <p>I, THE UNDERSIGNED, HEREBY CONFIRM:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I can be fired at any second, for no reason.</li>
                        <li>I might leave with zero proof of experience (No Certificate).</li>
                        <li>I cannot sue Coerror in a Labor Court.</li>
                        <li>If I want to sue, I have to pay for the Arbitration myself.</li>
                        <li>I have only 30 days to complain about anything, after that I am silent forever.</li>
                        <li>I understand that Coerror holds all the cards, and I am agreeing to this purely for the learning opportunity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Constructive Notice:</strong> The Entity is not obligated to personally notify the Participant of amendments. It is the Participant’s sole duty to review this legal framework periodically.</p>

                    <p><strong>Continued Use as Acceptance:</strong> If the Participant continues to contribute code, access communication channels, or interact with the Project after terms have been modified, such action constitutes an IRREVOCABLE ACCEPTANCE of the new terms.</p>

                    <h4>6.2 SEVERABILITY</h4>
                    <p><strong>6.2.1 Survival of Obligations:</strong> In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed from this text. The invalidity of a specific clause shall NOT affect the validity of the remaining clauses. The Agreement survives in full force and effect, notwithstanding the excision of any specific provision.</p>

                    <h4>6.3 ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h4>
                    <p><strong>6.3.1 Integration Clause:</strong> This Agreement constitutes the ENTIRE understanding between the Entity and the Participant. It supersedes, nullifies, and obliterates all prior:</p>

                    <p><strong>6.4.1 Interpretation Waiver:</strong> The Participant explicitly WAIVES the application of the Contra Proferentem doctrine. The Participant agrees that any ambiguity, vagueness, or confusion in this text shall be interpreted IN FAVOR OF THE ENTITY (Coerror) and strictly against the Participant.</p>

                    <h4>6.5 NOTICE AND COMMUNICATION</h4>
